###Insight Paragraphs
The area with the most 311 Noise Complaints were the Upper West & East sides, Midtown, and the Financial District. I think that the Upper West & East sides had a plurality of noise complaints as these NTAs are primarily residential quarters that pride themselves on its relative seclusion from the economic sectors of Manhattan. Midtown, I think has a plurality of noise complaints as there are noisy districts within the NTA such as the Theatre district and Times Square. The Financial District may have a large amount of 311 complaints due to the necessity for a quiet environment to conduct business. 

I notice that NTAs with the most complaints are centered in more affluent districts such as Chelsea and the Upper West & East sides. Less affluent districts such as East Harlem and Inwood have the fewest noise complaints. The additional data increased my knowledge on how useful QGIS is for visualizing data. By using a shapefile that had the boundaries of the Manhattan Police Precincts, I could visualize what precincts had to respond to the most complaints.
